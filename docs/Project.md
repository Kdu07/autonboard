# General Planning

The tests described in this document aim to ensure the **quality, reliability, performance, and usability** of the Equiem system. The planning includes positive and negative scenarios, evaluating both functional behavior and non-functional attributes, as well as the real experience of end users.

The tests were defined considering the business requirements, the constraints of the academic project, and the feasibility of execution in a controlled environment.

# Testing Tools and Technologies

The following tools were selected to support the testing process:

- **Postman**: manual and automated testing of REST APIs  
- **Jest** (or equivalent tool): automated testing of business logic  
- **Google Chrome**: manual functional tests and usability testing  
- **k6 / Apache JMeter**: load and concurrency simulation  
- **Google Sheets**: recording results and feedback from usability tests  
- **Markdown (.md)**: versioned and structured documentation of the test plan  

These tools were chosen due to their wide adoption in the industry, ease of use, and suitability for the academic context of the project.

# Functional Test Planning

## Functional Tests Overview

Functional tests aim to validate whether all functionalities of the Equiem system correctly meet the defined **Functional Requirements (FRs)**. The focus is on the complete onboarding workflow, from the initial upload to the final consolidation and external integration.

The planning includes both main flows and exception scenarios, ensuring that the system responds correctly to invalid inputs, operational errors, and unexpected interruptions.

## Functional Test Cases

### FR01 – Structured Onboarding Data Upload

**Objective:** Validate that authenticated users can upload CSV/XLSX files.

**Precondition:** User is authenticated in the system.

**Procedure**

1. Access the system with valid credentials  
2. Navigate to the onboarding screen  
3. Select the upload option  
4. Upload a CSV or XLSX file  
5. Confirm submission and wait for the system response  

**Positive Scenario**

- Upload of a valid file  

**Negative Scenario**

- Upload attempt without authentication or with an invalid format  

**Expected Result**

- Upload accepted or error handled correctly  

**Post-condition**

- File stored in the staging layer  

### FR02 – Data Standardization

**Objective:** Ensure that uploaded data is converted to the internal standardized model.

**Precondition:** File successfully uploaded.

**Procedure**

1. Trigger the standardization process  
2. Monitor logs and interface feedback  

**Positive Scenario**

- Data compatible with the schema  

**Negative Scenario**

- Missing or incompatible fields  

**Expected Result**

- Data standardized or error reported  

**Post-condition**

- Data ready for validation  

### FR03 – Intermediate Data Persistence

**Objective:** Verify the secure persistence of standardized data.

**Procedure**

- Save data in the intermediate storage layer  

**Expected Result**

- Data persisted without overwriting previous versions  

### FR04 – Data Validation and Conflict Detection

**Objective:** Identify errors, duplicates, and conflicts in the data.

**Procedure**

1. Execute the validation routine  
2. Analyze the generated report  

**Positive Scenario**

- Valid data approved  

**Negative Scenario**

- Invalid data generates alerts  

**Expected Result**

- Detailed error report generated  

### FR05 – Safe Data Correction via Re-Submission

**Objective:** Validate safe replacement of corrected data.

**Procedure**

1. Fix errors in the original file  
2. Resubmit a new version  
3. Confirm safe replacement  

**Expected Result**

- Previous data replaced correctly  

### FR06 – Change Comparison Visualization

**Objective:** Verify comparison between submitted versions.

**Expected Result**

- Differences highlighted correctly  

### FR07 – Automatic Progress Persistence

**Objective:** Ensure automatic progress saving.

**Procedure**

1. Close the system  
2. Reopen it later  

**Expected Result**

- Progress restored  

### FR08 – Dynamic Onboarding Interface

**Objective:** Validate dynamic display of sections according to active modules.

**Expected Result**

- Only relevant sections displayed  

### FR09 – Section Dependency Enforcement

**Objective:** Ensure dependent sections are properly blocked.

**Expected Result**

- Access blocked when prerequisites are not completed  

### FR10 – Collaborative Section Assignment

**Objective:** Validate assignment of sections to multiple collaborators.

**Expected Result**

- Parallel work enabled  

### FR11 – Onboarding Status and Feedback

**Objective:** Verify onboarding status tracking.

**Expected Result**

- Status correctly updated  

### FR12 – Data Consolidation and Secure Integration

**Objective:** Validate final data consolidation and external system integration.

**Procedure**

1. Complete all mandatory sections  
2. Generate consolidated data package  
3. Send it to the external system  
4. Confirm successful integration
